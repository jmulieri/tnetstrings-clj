tnetstrings-clj
===============

TNetstrings parser/encoder written in Clojure
---------------------------------------------
This project came out of the first ClojureDC meetup. We did a meet and greet, followed by an interactive hack on a TNetstrings parser. I'm learning Clojure, so I thought I'd follow through and build both pieces.

- Parser
- Encoder -- TODO
